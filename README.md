This is the dependency missing in Ubuntu 23 and 24.
You might need this if you want to install Cisco Packet Tracer, because the current release of CPT, as of (January, 28, 2025), is dependent on this on this and does not support Ubuntu 23 and 24
Simply clone this reop and install the dependency as you would any normal .deb file [sudo dpkg -i <package-name>]
Then simply install Cisco Packet-Tracer.
It might show some access denied or some other error, nut that wont concern us
